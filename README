slarchive, a SeedLink client for archiving data streams

For usage information see the slarchive(1) man page in the 'doc'

-- Building/Installing --

In most environments a simple 'make' will compile slarchive.

Using GCC, running 'make static' will compile a static version of slarchive
if possible.

GCC can be explicitly used by running 'make gcc'.

SunOS/Solaris:

In order to compile under Solaris the 'src/Makefile' needs to be edited.
See the file for instructions.

For further installation simply copy the resulting binary and man page
(in the 'doc' directory) to appropriate system directories.
